# Question

The endpoint `/api/data` is handled by the controller `serveData` below.

If I send a request to `/api/data?filter=frog`, how do I get the value of the query parameter `filter`?

```js
const serveData = (req, res, next) => {
  const filterValue = ???
  // use the filterValue and send back a response
}
app.get('/api/data', serveData);
```

# Answer
You get the value of the filter query parameter by using req.query.filter. The req object represents the incoming request and the query property is an object that holds all the query parameters.  req.query.filter would equal "frog".
